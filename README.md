# Trainguard MT CBTC AtsEX version
## Overview
BVE5/6 implementation of the advanced Siemens Trainguard MT CBTC ATP+ATO signalling system.  

Supports the simulation of ATO and ATP, both CTC(moving block) and ITC(fixed block) signalling modes, while focusing on various details.  

This is an AtsEX-based rebuilt version of the [TGMT-CBTC plugin developed by Zbx1425](https://github.com/zbx1425/TGMT-CBTC).
